 I use http-server for testing, local development and learning purposes.
 
 Install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line anywhere:
    npm install --global http-server

 Use npx to run the script:
    npx http-server

 Visit http://localhost:8080 to view the server.

 Index.html will be served as the default file to any directory requests.
